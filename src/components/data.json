A recent finding suggests that in some cases, people will complete a task as soon as possible, even if doing so requires extra effort (Rosenbaum et al., 2014). Some of my current work is investigating this effect in cognitive tasks to better understand how we choose when to complete cognitive tasks and whether this choice is based on reducing ones cognitive load.",
